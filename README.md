#A Web and Python Tkinter based simple calculator using solution for a problem I found during a leetcode venture


[Web Calculator Live Demo](https://underemployed.github.io/Web_and_tkinter_calculator/)  

The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has features such as a clear button to reset the calculations and a decimal button to allow for decimal point inputs.

One of the key improvements I made to the calculator is the addition of a dark mode option, which I find easier on the eyes for extended use. I also added a button to toggle the mode easily.
